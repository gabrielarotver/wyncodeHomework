The catsInHats.rb file shows code that makes 100 passes over cats. On the first pass, every cat gets its hat removed. 
on the second pass, every other cat gets its hat replaced. On the third cat, every third cat is visited, and if it's hatted
their hat is removed, if it doesn't have a hat, then the hat is replaced. This pattern continues. The final result
shows that cats without hats are the ones at positions that are perfect squares.

The stock_ticker.rb program allows user to enter a stock symbol, and it will reply with the stock's price as well as it's closing 
value.
